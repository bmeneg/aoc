# My Advent of Code solutions

This is my personal repo for some of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.

## Goal

The goal is to learn different programming languages using AoC puzzles, meaining all the solutions **are designedly**
to be over engineered and not the best/fastest implementation ever. Once again, **this repo is meant to be my personal
way of learning new language features and not to be the best puzzle solver**.
